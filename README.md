#TIMEOUT
---------------
###Description:
Timeout is a small shitty react app designed to introduce randomness into your life.
It will eventually let you set a timer anywhere for the next 1000 years, and will accept randomness from years down to ms.
That means, you may set an alarm that you're not sure when it will go off! How fun! Eventually it will include an emailer and an electron launcher.
I don't think it'll need redux

###Goals:
0. Add coverage to api side

###Development:
1. TDD enforced. I can't know if anyone else is doing so, but it's mandatory for me
2. No breaking merges
3. No breaking linting
4. PR-per-feature
