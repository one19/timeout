# Welcome To Timeout API

It's the api for timeout! It's got users and timers! That's IT!

The timers store the offset in minutes, the start time, and the time until the timer ends both in ms.

The timers also store a bit of information about randomness. Timers are allowed to be completely random, from year, to ms, and any combination inbetween.

Timers also now store the user id of the user they belong to, for storage access.

This was created using the forked offspring of prismatik/generator-dendritic: shortlyster/generator-breadbeard.
